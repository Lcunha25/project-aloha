#Aloha Project
## This is our aloha project for RED academy. It should be a responsive website built on CSS, HTML and Javascript.

# About products tab
###on Products tab I have saved the configuration to be responsive. For that I had to use porcentages of page for each atribute and define the borders as margins as well.

#Banner
###to control the size of the girl so that it would look like the one on the project picture and to contain the sizing of the project a contain atribute was added specifically on the girl picture.
