# Banner
### to control the size of the girl so that it would look like the one on the project picture and to contain the sizing of the project a contain atribute was added specifically on the girl picture.

# Sales Tab
### On the sales tab we choose to use flickity to structure our responsive slider. That way most of the product lining becomes automatic and little is necessary on the developers end.

# Responsive
### The website uses a mobile first approach. Anything above 600px is consider tablet and will forward the user to the tablet sizings, the same applies for the desktop version above 1240px.
